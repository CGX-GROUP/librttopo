YYYY-MM-DD

 # Important / Breaking Changes

 - Support for tolerance/precision=0 added, -1 is the new value
   for automatic computation of minimal tolerance.

 - The getEdgeWithinBox2D backend callback needs to support a NULL
   value as BBOX pointer (to return all edges)

 # New Features

 - Function `rtt_AddLineNoFace`, to add lines w/out determining new
   faces (WARNING: leaves topology in an invalid state)

 - Function `rtt_Polygonize`, to determine all faces generated by
   existing edges.

 - Function `rtt_tpsnap`, to snap linear components of a geometry
   to edges of a topology.
