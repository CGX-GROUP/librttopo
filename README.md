This is a fork of PostGIS' liblwgeom, moved to its own repository to
allow for faster release cycles independent from PostGIS itself.

It is a work in progress, still not ready for use.

Official code repository is https://git.osgeo.org/gogs/rttopo/librttopo.

A mirror exists at https://gitlab.com/rttopo/rttopo, automatically
updated on every push to the official repository.
